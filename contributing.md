# Contributing to CentralInquiry.com

Welcome to the **Node_Zero Metaverse Project**. This is not just a website or a narrative—it's a living, collaborative metaverse told through code, story threads, decentralized identity, and NFT artifacts.

We invite writers, artists, developers, and futurists to help shape the story.

3. **Add your content** in the appropriate folder

## Guidelines

- Stay within the aesthetic and ethical boundaries of the Node_Zero world (cyberpunk, decentralized, post-collapse, seeking redemption)
- Be respectful of other contributors
- Avoid breaking the continuity of major canonical events unless it’s intentional and clearly marked.
- You may create alternative timelines or speculative forks, as long as it's intentional and clearly marked.
